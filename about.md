Hi, I'm Todd. 

I am passionate about creating software, art, and good design. I moved to Waterloo ON, after studying and working in Calgary AB.
I worked at a Science Centre there where I learned some of the fundamentals of User Experience and Design thinking. Before that, I studied sculpture and new media at Alberta College of Art and Design _now AUArts_ I am happiest when I am Rock Climbing but a close second is when I am finding clever ways to solve people's problems.

I am currently going to College for Computer Applications Development for a Post Graduate Certificate. I would like to find a co-op this summer where I get to use my entrepreneurial mindset and hard earned programming chops to make an impact.
