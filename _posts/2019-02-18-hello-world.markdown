I am pretty excited about getting to write about some of the projects I am currently working on. I have a Progressive Web App tutorial I am working through, a voice activated Raspberry Pi experiment, and a [Do-Sask][doSask] [chat-bot][chatBot] that I am building for my sister. 

This weekend I tapped away at the ECommerce-VueJs Climbing Store application. I got a bunch of stuff working including:
* Tables for orders & carts 
* Columns for product cards 
* Wasted a ton of time trying to get images

Still needs:
* images to work
* comments and ratings
* guest account

This week I want to get up to speed on my Capstone Project and start sorting out if I can use My Treasure Hunt Idea or Climate Science Api for my mobile development class. 

I think I will try to get some of my older jquery stuff up onto github when I get back from GRR.
